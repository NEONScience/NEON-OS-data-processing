Description: NEON observational data are provided via the NEON Data Portal <https://www.neonscience.org> 
  and NEON API, and can be downloaded and reformatted by the 'neonUtilities' package. NEON observational data 
  (human-observed measurements, and analyses derived from human-collected samples, such as tree diameters and 
  algal chemistry) are published in a format consisting of one or more tabular data files. This package provides 
  tools for performing common operations on NEON observational data, including checking for duplicates and 
  joining tables.
